# Personal-Portfolio
## Introduction 
A personal Portfolio helps you to put some information about yourself. So in this project, I made a Personal Portfolio that has much information about me like:
* My Name
* Field Of studying and My University
* My CV       : Download it
* LinkedIn Account
* Knowledge   : Knowledge I got from my studies 
* My Beliefs  : About Hardworking and Succeeding
* My Projects : My University Projects and Self Projects
* My Email    : If you want to contact with me
  
## How I Made This Project

 I used JavaScript to add some EventListener like : click, mouseout, and mouseover.
